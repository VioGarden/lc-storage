approaches
1. (1) hashmap, each letter asigned a number for how many occurances
    T: O(s + t)
    M: O(s + t)

2. (2) Sorted Method, sort then compare
    T: O(n^2) if bad sorting system (ie bubble sort)
    M: O(1)

    T: O(n log n) if good sorting algorithm
    M: (iffy), could be O(n), or O(1), depends on the situation


3. (3) Counter(s) == Counter(t)

4. (4) idk bad



notes
.get(keyname,value)
    -works for dictionaries
    -keyname (required) what key you want the value from
    -value (optionary) value to return if key does not exist
