Explaination:
use edges to advantage
Binary search has left, mid, anf right pointer

1. find mid value
2. if mid value is greater than left most value, means we are in left portion of array
    -if mid value is not greater than left most value, we are in the right portion of array
3. compare to left most value, 
    -if less than, can eliminate left portion to the left
    -if greater than, remove everything from the right
3. if in right portion
    - if greater than right edge, search everything to the edge
    - if less than edge, can eliminate everything to left
