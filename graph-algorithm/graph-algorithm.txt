DFS 
    -Time : O(n)
    -DS : HashSet

BFS
    -Time : O(n)
    -DS : Queue (double ended), HashSet

Union Find (union/combine disjoint sets efficiently)
    -Time: O(nlogn)
    -DS : Forest of Trees
    -Ex: number of connected components by adding edges

Topological Sort
    -From DFS
    -Graph that is directed in one way
    -Time : O(n)
    -DS : HashSet

Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm
    -Time : ElogV  # E is edges, V is verticies
    -DS : Heap or Priority Queue, HashSet
